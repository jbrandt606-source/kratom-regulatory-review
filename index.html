    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Kratom (<em>Mitragyna speciosa</em>) is a plant-derived substance containing
      multiple alkaloids, including mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.
      This review consolidates publicly available federal surveillance reporting,
      adverse event databases, poison control exposure data, regulatory
      communications, and peer-reviewed scientific literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of this site is to provide a centralized reference resource
      for legislative, regulatory, and research staff evaluating public health
      considerations associated with kratom.

        <h3>Mortality Surveillance</h3>
        <p>
          Federal and state surveillance systems have reported cases in which
          kratom alkaloids were identified in postmortem toxicology.
          This section summarizes available CDC reporting, including
          instances where kratom was listed among substances detected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reporting methodologies, co-occurring substances, and
          classification practices are noted where available.

        <h3>Adverse Event Reporting</h3>
        <p>
          The U.S. Food and Drug Administration maintains adverse event
          reporting systems that include submissions referencing
          kratom-containing products. This section compiles publicly
          accessible data from FDA databases, including reported
          clinical outcomes and recall communications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adverse event submissions do not independently establish
          causation but provide surveillance indicators for further review.

        <p>
          National Poison Data System (NPDS) reporting includes calls

          trends, reported clinical effects, and severity classifications.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What is kratom?</h3>
      <p>
        Kratom refers to the plant <em>Mitragyna speciosa</em>, which contains
        multiple alkaloids, including mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.
        These compounds have been studied for pharmacologic activity.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>What types of public health data are available?</h3>
      <p>
        Publicly available data include CDC mortality surveillance,
        FDA adverse event reporting systems, poison control exposure
        summaries, and peer-reviewed toxicology literature.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Does this site make policy recommendations?</h3>
      <p>
        No. This site compiles publicly available information for

        specific regulatory actions.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h3>Do adverse event reports establish causation?</h3>
      <p>
        Adverse event submissions provide surveillance signals but
        do not independently establish causation without further
        scientific or clinical evaluation.
