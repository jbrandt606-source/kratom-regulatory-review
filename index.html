  <div class="container">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Kratom (<em>Mitragyna speciosa</em>) is a plant-derived substance containing
      multiple alkaloids, including mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine.
      This site consolidates publicly accessible federal and scientific sources
      relevant to legislative and regulatory evaluation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sources include mortality surveillance systems, adverse event databases,
      poison control exposure reporting, regulatory safety communications,
      and peer-reviewed pharmacologic and toxicologic research.

    <h2>Mortality Surveillance</h2>
    <p>
      Federal surveillance systems have reported cases in which
      kratom alkaloids were identified in postmortem toxicology.
      Annual CDC SUDORS counts and historical federal reports
      are summarized in a dedicated mortality reference page.

    <h2>Poison Control (NPDS) Data</h2>
    <p>
      The National Poison Data System (NPDS) compiles real-time reports
      from U.S. poison centers regarding kratom exposures.
      These reports include case volume, single-substance exposures,
      pediatric involvement, healthcare facility management,
      and medical outcome classifications (minor, moderate, major, fatal).
    </p>
    <p>
      Annual trends and peer-reviewed poison-center analyses
      are summarized in a dedicated poison control reference page.

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <p><strong>What is kratom?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Kratom refers to the plant <em>Mitragyna speciosa</em>, which contains alkaloids
      including mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine that have documented pharmacologic activity.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Does this site make policy recommendations?</strong></p>
    <p>
      No. This site compiles publicly available federal and scientific information
      for educational and legislative reference. It does not advocate specific
      regulatory actions.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Do adverse event reports establish causation?</strong></p>
    <p>
      Adverse event submissions provide surveillance indicators but do not
      independently establish causation without further scientific evaluation.
