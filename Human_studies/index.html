      <h3>FDA-Registered Human Laboratory Study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06072170)</h3>

      <p>
        This Phase I clinical study evaluated the safety and subjective effects
        of single-dose oral kratom powder in healthy adult volunteers.
        The study was conducted under controlled laboratory conditions.
      </p>

      <h4>Study Design</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Healthy adult participants</li>
        <li>Opioid-experienced (not opioid-naïve)</li>
        <li>Single-dose administration</li>
        <li>Five escalating dose levels (up to approximately 12 grams of kratom powder)</li>
        <li>Placebo-controlled, clinical research setting</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        Phase I studies are designed to evaluate short-term safety and pharmacologic effects.
        They are not intended to evaluate long-term use, dependence, or chronic exposure.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Formation of 7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-OH)</h4>

      <p>
        The kratom material used in the study contained minimal pre-formed
        7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH).
      </p>

      <p>
        However, measurable 7-OH was detected in participants’ blood after dosing.
        This indicates that 7-OH was produced inside the body through metabolic
        conversion of mitragynine.
      </p>

      <p>
        7-OH has stronger activity at the mu-opioid receptor than mitragynine.
        Blood concentrations of 7-OH increased with higher kratom doses.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        The presence of 7-OH in circulation reflects internal metabolic formation
        rather than high levels in the plant material itself.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Subjective Effects (“Drug Liking” and “Feeling High”)</h4>

      <p>
        Participants completed standardized rating scales measuring subjective
        drug effects, including “drug liking” and “feeling high.”
      </p>

      <p>
        At higher doses, statistically significant increases in these measures
        were observed compared to placebo.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Effects were dose-dependent.</li>
        <li>Lower doses produced minimal subjective changes.</li>
        <li>Higher doses produced measurable increases in reported drug effect.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Reports of intense euphoria were limited, but measurable abuse-liability
        signals were present at higher dose levels.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Adverse Effects Observed</h4>

      <p>
        The most commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events included:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Dizziness</li>
        <li>Somnolence (sleepiness)</li>
        <li>Anxiety</li>
        <li>Presyncope (near-fainting)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Adverse effects increased in frequency at higher dose levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        No deaths were reported. No severe respiratory depression was observed
        in this single-dose setting.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Participant Withdrawals</h4>

      <p>
        Some participants were withdrawn from the study:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Elevated liver enzymes (ALT/AST) at higher dose levels</li>
        <li>Gastrointestinal intolerance</li>
        <li>Vasovagal syncope during blood draw (fainting episode)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Two participants at the highest dose level were withdrawn due to
        liver enzyme elevations.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        No serious adverse events were reported in this study.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Study Conduct and Sponsorship</h4>

      <p>
        The study was funded by a commercial kratom manufacturer
        (Johnson Foods / NP Pharma).
      </p>

      <p>
        Clinical trial operations were conducted by a contract research organization
        (SGS Nutrasource, Canada).
      </p>

      <p>
        Several authors disclosed consulting relationships with the sponsor.

      <h3>2024 Human Pharmacokinetic Study (Molecules)</h3>

      <p>
        This peer-reviewed study evaluated how mitragynine and
        7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) move through the body after both
        single and repeated daily doses of dried kratom leaf powder.
      </p>

      <h4>Study Purpose</h4>
      <p>
        The goal was to measure blood concentrations, metabolism,
        accumulation over time, and steady-state levels under controlled conditions.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) Formation</h4>

      <p>
        The kratom powder used in this study contained extremely low
        amounts of 7-OH prior to administration.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dosing, measurable 7-OH was detected in participant blood samples.
        This confirms that 7-OH was primarily produced through liver metabolism
        of mitragynine rather than being present in high concentrations
        in the original plant material.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although 7-OH blood levels were lower than mitragynine levels,
        7-OH was consistently detectable across dose levels.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        7-OH has greater mu-opioid receptor activity than mitragynine.
        The study demonstrates that even low-7-OH plant material
        results in systemic exposure to this metabolite.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Single-Dose Findings</h4>

      <ul>
        <li>Blood levels of mitragynine increased proportionally with dose.</li>
        <li>7-OH levels increased alongside mitragynine.</li>
        <li>No unexpected metabolic byproducts were identified.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Higher doses resulted in higher peak concentrations (Cmax)
        and overall drug exposure (AUC).
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Repeated Daily Dosing (15 Days)</h4>

      <p>
        Participants received repeated daily doses for approximately two weeks.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Steady-state concentrations were reached in approximately 7–9 days.</li>
        <li>Low-to-moderate accumulation of mitragynine was observed.</li>
        <li>7-OH remained detectable throughout repeated dosing.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The ratio of 7-OH to mitragynine was highest after single doses
        and decreased somewhat with repeated dosing, but did not disappear.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Adverse Events</h4>

      <p>
        Reported adverse effects were similar to those seen in the 2026 safety trial:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Dizziness</li>
        <li>Somnolence</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        No severe respiratory depression was observed in the controlled study setting.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Regulatory-Relevant Context</h4>

      <p>
        This study confirms that:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>7-OH is produced systemically after kratom ingestion.</li>
        <li>7-OH exposure increases with higher doses.</li>
        <li>Repeated dosing results in sustained exposure over time.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The study does not evaluate long-term chronic use,
        dependence development, or polydrug use scenarios.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4>Funding Disclosure</h4>

      <p>
        The study was funded by Johnson Foods.
        Authors disclosed consulting relationships with the sponsor.

      <h3>Summary Across Controlled Human Studies</h3>

      <p>
        Controlled human studies of kratom remain limited in number, but the studies summarized here
        provide structured information on metabolism, short-term tolerability, and measurable subjective effects
        under supervised conditions.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Findings (Plain Language)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) is produced in the body.</strong>
          Even when the kratom product contains very little 7-OH, participants still develop measurable 7-OH in blood,
          indicating metabolic conversion from mitragynine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Higher doses increase exposure.</strong>
          Both mitragynine and 7-OH blood levels rise with dose, and repeated dosing results in sustained exposure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drug-effect ratings increase at higher doses.</strong>
          In the FDA-registered single-dose study, higher doses were associated with statistically significant increases
          in subjective ratings such as “drug liking” and “feeling high.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Short-term side effects were common and dose-related.</strong>
          Nausea, dizziness, headache, sleepiness, and similar effects were reported more often at higher doses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Some participants were withdrawn.</strong>
          Withdrawals occurred for reasons including elevated liver enzymes at higher doses and gastrointestinal intolerance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h4>What These Studies Do Not Evaluate</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Long-term, high-frequency chronic use over months or years</li>
        <li>Adolescents and pediatric exposures</li>
        <li>Population-level incidence (how common events are in the general public)</li>
        <li>Real-world retail variability, including concentrated extracts and polydrug use</li>
        <li>Development of dependence and withdrawal under long-term daily use</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        Controlled trials are designed to measure effects under specific conditions. Surveillance systems
        (mortality, poison control, adverse event reporting) capture broader real-world patterns and are presented
        elsewhere on this site.
