    <!-- STUDY 1: HUESTIS 2026 SAFETY/TRIAL -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Randomized Safety & Tolerability Trial (Huestis et al., 2026)</h3>

      <p>
        This was a controlled clinical study in healthy adults designed to evaluate
        short-term safety and side effects of dried kratom leaf powder compared with placebo.
        Participants received single doses and then 15 daily doses in a supervised setting.  [oai_citation:0‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)
      </p>

      <h4>What was studied (plain language)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>116 volunteers total (49 received kratom; 67 received placebo).  [oai_citation:1‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)</li>
        <li>Four dose levels of mitragynine (6.65, 13.3, 26.6, 53.2 mg).  [oai_citation:2‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)</li>
        <li>Product contained very little pre-formed 7-OH (&lt;0.01%), meaning most 7-OH exposure comes from metabolism in the body.  [oai_citation:3‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>7-OH produced in the body</h4>
      <p>
        The paper explains that 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) is primarily formed in humans
        through metabolism of mitragynine (largely via CYP3A4), rather than being present in fresh leaf.  [oai_citation:4‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)
      </p>

      <h4>Side effects reported</h4>
      <p>
        No deaths and no serious adverse events were reported. Side effects generally increased with higher doses.  [oai_citation:5‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Most common after single dose: dizziness, nausea, feeling relaxed.  [oai_citation:6‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)</li>
        <li>Most common after multiple daily dosing: headache, feeling hot, elevated ALT, nausea.  [oai_citation:7‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Drug liking / “high”</h4>
      <p>
        The study collected abuse-liability signals (including “drug effect” ratings) and reports that
        euphoric mood was uncommon: it was reported in only a small number of participants and was not reported
        during the multiple-dose phase in active kratom recipients.  [oai_citation:8‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)
      </p>

      <h4>Did anyone drop out?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes. The paper reports early terminations for suspected product-related events, including elevated liver enzymes and
        severe gastroenteritis in one case; some participants were also withdrawn at higher doses due to ALT/AST elevations that resolved after stopping dosing.  [oai_citation:9‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)
      </p>

      <h4>Who sponsored and who conducted it?</h4>
      <p>
        Funding disclosure in the paper states the study was paid for by NP Pharma, and authors report consultant fees from NP Pharma.
        Study product referenced: MitraLeaf (encapsulated dried kratom leaf powder).  [oai_citation:10‡Huestis study 2026.pdf](sediment://file_00000000a93871f5a4f74b3008b814bf)

    <!-- STUDY 2: HUESTIS 2024 PK -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Human Pharmacokinetics of Mitragynine and 7-OH (Huestis et al., 2024)</h3>

      <p>
        This study measured how mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) appear in blood
        after single dosing and after repeated daily dosing of encapsulated dried kratom leaf powder.  [oai_citation:11‡Huestis PK 2024.pdf](sediment://file_0000000040e471f5a2324f61488d5b8b)
      </p>

      <h4>Why this matters</h4>
      <p>
        Even when the product contains extremely low 7-OH, the study demonstrates measurable 7-OH in plasma
        because the body converts mitragynine into 7-OH.  [oai_citation:12‡Huestis PK 2024.pdf](sediment://file_0000000040e471f5a2324f61488d5b8b)
      </p>

      <h4>Key findings in plain language</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Both mitragynine and 7-OH increased with higher doses.  [oai_citation:13‡Huestis PK 2024.pdf](sediment://file_0000000040e471f5a2324f61488d5b8b)</li>
        <li>Steady-state levels were reached in about 8–9 days for mitragynine and ~7 days for 7-OH.  [oai_citation:14‡Huestis PK 2024.pdf](sediment://file_0000000040e471f5a2324f61488d5b8b)</li>
        <li>The 7-OH/mitragynine ratio was higher after single dosing and decreased somewhat after repeated dosing.  [oai_citation:15‡Huestis PK 2024.pdf](sediment://file_0000000040e471f5a2324f61488d5b8b)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Sponsorship and conduct</h4>
      <p>
        The paper reports that the clinical study was paid for by Johnson Foods, LLC, and conducted by SGS Nutrasource in Ontario, Canada,
        with disclosed consulting relationships.  [oai_citation:16‡Huestis PK 2024.pdf](sediment://file_0000000040e471f5a2324f61488d5b8b)

    <!-- STUDY 3: FDA-REGISTERED TRIAL (CLINICALTRIALS.GOV) -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>FDA-Registered Human Study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT06072170)</h3>

      <p>
        This is an FDA-registered human study with results posted on ClinicalTrials.gov.
        It evaluated single-dose kratom administration under controlled conditions and includes
        outcomes such as measured alkaloid exposure (including 7-OH formation) and standardized
        subjective effect scales (e.g., drug liking and “high” ratings).
      </p>

      <h4>Why it is relevant</h4>
      <p>
        ClinicalTrials.gov results provide a standardized view of participant-reported effects and laboratory measurements
        in a controlled setting. These results are helpful for understanding dose response and short-term tolerability
        but do not represent long-term use or real-world retail variability.

      <h3>Summary Across Controlled Human Studies</h3>

      <p>
        Controlled human studies of kratom remain limited in number, but the studies summarized here
        provide structured information on metabolism, short-term tolerability, and measurable subjective effects
        under supervised conditions.
      </p>

      <h4>Key Findings (Plain Language)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH) is produced in the body.</strong>
          Even when the kratom product contains very little 7-OH, participants still develop measurable 7-OH in blood,
          indicating metabolic conversion from mitragynine.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Higher doses increase exposure.</strong>
          Both mitragynine and 7-OH blood levels rise with dose, and repeated dosing results in sustained exposure.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Drug-effect ratings increase at higher doses.</strong>
          In the FDA-registered single-dose study, higher doses were associated with statistically significant increases
          in subjective ratings such as “drug liking” and “feeling high.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Short-term side effects were common and dose-related.</strong>
          Nausea, dizziness, headache, sleepiness, and similar effects were reported more often at higher doses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Some participants were withdrawn.</strong>
          Withdrawals occurred for reasons including elevated liver enzymes at higher doses and gastrointestinal intolerance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h4>What These Studies Do Not Evaluate</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Long-term, high-frequency chronic use over months or years</li>
        <li>Adolescents and pediatric exposures</li>
        <li>Population-level incidence (how common events are in the general public)</li>
        <li>Real-world retail variability, including concentrated extracts and polydrug use</li>
        <li>Development of dependence and withdrawal under long-term daily use</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">
        Controlled trials are designed to measure effects under specific conditions. Surveillance systems
        (mortality, poison control, adverse event reporting) capture broader real-world patterns and are presented
        elsewhere on this site.
